      <h3>Role: Robotics and AI Research Engineer</h3>

      <p>Leading AI-driven development of non-invasive biopsy guidance devices, R&D deep learning models into
real-world clinical applications.</p>


            
    <h6>AI & Computer Vision Research:</h6>

    <ul>

    <li>Researched and designed a novel single-shot object detection and tracking model in PyTorch for
    real-time instrument tracking, including modeling needle bending for accurate trajectory prediction.</li>

    <li>
    Optimized deep learning models using TensorRT, quantization techniques, resulting in a 100%
    improvement in inference speed.
    </li>

    <li>
    Designed an automated annotation pipeline in Blender to generate synthetic data, significantly
    cutting dependency on real data and improving model localization accuracy from 93% to 97%.
    </li>

    <li>
    Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agent leveraging Hugging Face, OpenAI
    API, and LangChain to automate summarization of multiple research papers.
    </li>

    </ul>


    <h6>
    Clinical Integration & Deployment:
    </h6>

    <ul>

    <li>
    Integrated the optimized model into our medical device, enabling real-time needle tracking and
    achieving 17 successful clinical trials with sub-2mm precision in target localization.
    </li>

    <li>
    Streamlined data collection, annotation, and training pipeline, reducing model adaptation time from
    4–6 weeks to approximately 1 week.
    </li>
    </ul>


    <h6>Leadership:</h6>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Led a 3-member team through end-to-end AI model lifecycle from R&D to clinical deployment.
    </li>
    </ul>
