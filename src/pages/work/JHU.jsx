      <h3>Role: Research Assistant (2022 - 2023)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Thesis Achievement: Developed an advanced MRI-guided biopsy needle tracking system integrating
            Broyden's Update with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), implemented via ROS2 packages, achieving
            30-40% improved localization accuracy over conventional methods.</li>
            <li>
            Developed a robotic system for precise, repeatable needle insertions in phantom experiments.

            </li>

            <li>
            Created a ROS package to spawn a custom-designed quadcopter, modeled in URDF, within the Gazebo
            simulation environment
            </li>
        </ul>
            
    <h3>Teaching Assistant (2022 - 2023)</h3>

    <ul>
            <li>Developed curriculum and course content for graduate-level Robot System Programming course.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mentored graduate students on advanced ROS2 projects including action libraries, Gazebo Ignition
        simulation, and Orocos integration.
            </li>
